# About ?

This demo  Python code makes use of the STARWARS API aka "SWAPI" which is a great resource 
for learning about the concept of REST APIS. There are various endpoints , but for this 
demo . i chose to use the 'planets' endpoint which contains exactly 60 records with various key value pairs.

NB : I have also attached a python script which contains a similar code should you prefer to run it as a script
